			 The internal structure structure of the stars, their life cycle and many more. I found the concept is very clearn, but the author 
			skip significant steps in the derivationof the equation. Its part second about stellar atmosphere make it complete book.</h1>

	<div class = " Courses"> 
	<li >Astroinformatics : This course offered by IANCU and taught by Professor Kinoshita Daisuke. This course is mainly for the one who want to improve their python and the way they want to make their code looks good. I really appreciate Professor's effort. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Stellar: Stellar structure and evolutionn, Stellar structure and atmosphere are the courses taught by Prof Chen-Wen Ping, and Prof Kinoshita Daisuke. These both courses are about the evolution and the structure of the stars. These courses help me understand a lot more about stars.
	</li>
	<li>
		Astrophysics of Galaxy: Taught by Prof Yen-Chen Pan, one of the important course to understand about our galaxy. The way professor taught this subject is amazing.
